# 🕵️‍♂️ Web Information Gathering

## 📘 Introduction

The **Information Gathering** phase is the first and one of the most critical steps in web application penetration testing. The goal is to collect as much information as possible about the target — without (in passive mode) or with (in active mode) interacting with it directly. This information helps to identify technologies, entry points, and potential vulnerabilities.

## 🔹 Types of Information Gathering

### 1. Passive Information Gathering

Passive reconnaissance involves collecting data without directly interacting with the target. It's stealthy and useful for avoiding detection.

#### 🔧 Tools and Techniques:

- **Whois**
  - 🔍 Retrieves domain registration information, including registrant, contact, and name server details.
  - 🧪 Example:
    ```bash
    whois example.com
    ```

- **DNS Enumeration**
  - ⛓️ Retrieves DNS records such as A, MX, NS, TXT.
  - 🧪 Examples:
    ```bash
    nslookup example.com
    dig example.com any
    host -a example.com
    ```

- **Google Dorking**
  - 🔎 Leverages advanced Google search queries to discover sensitive information.
  - 🧪 Examples:
    ```
    site:example.com filetype:pdf
    inurl:admin site:example.com
    intitle:index.of site:example.com
    ```

- **Wayback Machine**
  - 🕰️ Used to view historical snapshots of websites: [https://archive.org/web](https://archive.org/web)

- **bgp.he.net**
  - 🌍 A useful website for discovering an organization’s **ASN (Autonomous System Number)**, IP ranges, and associated domains.
  - 🧪 Example: Search for `"Microsoft"` → shows IP ranges and subnets owned by Microsoft.

- **Shodan / Censys**
  - 🌐 Internet search engines that reveal information about exposed services/devices.
  - 🧪 Shodan example:
    ```bash
    org:"company name"
    hostname:"example.com"
    ssl:"example.com"
    ```

- **theHarvester**
  - 🧲 Gathers emails, subdomains, hosts, and usernames from public sources.
  - 🧪 Example:
    ```bash
    theHarvester -d example.com -b google
    ```

- **Recon-ng**
  - 🛠️ A modular OSINT framework for automated reconnaissance.
  - 🧪 Sample workflow:
    ```bash
    recon-ng
    > marketplace install all
    > use domains-contacts/whois_pocs
    > run
    ```

- **Amass (Intel Mode)**
  - 🧩 Collects ASN, subdomains, and infrastructure related to an organization.
  - 🧪 Example:
    ```bash
    amass intel -org "Tesla"
    ```

### 2. Active Information Gathering

Active recon involves direct interaction with the target — sending requests, scanning ports, and probing services. It can be detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS).

#### 🔧 Tools and Techniques:

- **Nmap**
  - 🌐 Performs port scanning and service/version detection.
  - 🧪 Example:
    ```bash
    nmap -sV -T4 -Pn example.com
    ```

- **WhatWeb / Wappalyzer**
  - 🧠 Identifies web technologies such as server software, CMS, JavaScript frameworks, etc.
  - 🧪 Example:
    ```bash
    whatweb example.com
    ```

- **Gobuster / Dirb / FFUF**
  - 📂 Enumerates hidden directories and files by brute-forcing paths.
  - 🧪 Example:
    ```bash
    gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
    ```

- **hakrevdns**
  - 🔄 Performs reverse DNS lookups over a range of IPs to discover hostnames and subdomains.
  - 🧪 Example:
    ```bash
    hakrevdns 192.168.0.0/24
    ```

- **prips**
  - 🗂️ Generates all IPs within a subnet. Very useful to feed into other tools like hakrevdns.
  - 🧪 Example:
    ```bash
    prips 192.168.0.0/24 | hakrevdns
    ```

- **SSL/TLS Scanning (testssl.sh / sslscan)**
  - 🔐 Detects SSL/TLS versions, supported ciphers, certificate issues.
  - 🧪 Example:
    ```bash
    testssl.sh example.com
    ```

- **WAF Detection (wafw00f)**
  - 🛡️ Identifies Web Application Firewalls protecting the target.
  - 🧪 Example:
    ```bash
    wafw00f https://example.com
    ```

## 📌 Key Information to Collect

- Subdomains and virtual hosts  
- IP ranges and ASNs  
- Web server technologies (e.g., Apache, Nginx)  
- Backend languages (PHP, Python, ASP.NET, etc.)  
- Frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Angular)  
- Login/admin panels  
- Public APIs  
- Hidden files or folders (e.g., `.git`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`)  
- HTTP headers and status codes  
- SSL certificates and security settings
